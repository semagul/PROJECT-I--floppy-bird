Welcome to the Flappy Bird project! [You can access the game by clicking here.](https://semawebdev.github.io/flappy-bird) The objective is to navigate the bird through pipes using the mouse or the space button. The player scores one point each second, so the bird doesn't crash into a pipe or the ground.
